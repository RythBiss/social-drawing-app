6 - [DONE] Make sure all documents are generated when a new account is created.

Bugs:
1 - [FIXED] Menu causes whole page to get a scroll bar, it should not.
2 - Undo sometimes causes stroke to appear different. Hard to replicate.
3 - [FIXED] Can't see stars on smaller resolutions.

14 - [FIXED] Eraser needs a visual indicator that it is toggled on.

22 - Following and Draw have some style issues on portrait mode.
23 - Clicking on profile needs the page to jump to the top.

Carrie's Bugs:
[FIXED] it doesn't show me what the colors are, just purple circles and i have to guess
[FIXED] I used the undo, and it undid the last line. but then it basically acted as if I had held the pen down from that point, moving towards the undo button (So Z would turn into >, but when i moved my pen it would be like >,)
[IGNORE] Sometimes the big circle pen turned square for no reason, but that wasn't a huge deal it might just be the tool
[FIXED] and the redo button had the same issue as the undo

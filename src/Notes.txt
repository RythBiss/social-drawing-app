Bugs:

2 - Undo sometimes causes stroke to appear different. Hard to replicate.
3 - [FIXED] Can't see stars on smaller resolutions.

12 - Clicking profile while viewing another profile does not load users profile.
13 - Add some input verifications to sign in, sign up, change name, and upload profile image

Carrie's Bugs:
[FIXED] it doesn't show me what the colors are, just purple circles and i have to guess
[FIXED] I used the undo, and it undid the last line. but then it basically acted as if I had held the pen down from that point, moving towards the undo button (So Z would turn into >, but when i moved my pen it would be like >,)
[IGNORE] Sometimes the big circle pen turned square for no reason, but that wasn't a huge deal it might just be the tool
[FIXED] and the redo button had the same issue as the undo

Big Tasks:
1 - History page loads only the signed in users posts, displays in a grid.
2 - When you click on a post, it should take you to the users page.
3 - Star functionality: click to give post a star, click again to revoke star.

Bugs:
1 - Menu causes whole page to get a scroll bar, it should not.
2 - Undo sometimes causes stroke to appear different. Hard to replicate.
3 - Can't see stars on smaller resolutions.
4 - Posts are loaded oldest to newest, should be reverse.
5 - Signout freezes the app.

Big Tasks:
1 - [STARTED] History page loads only the signed in users posts, displays in a grid.
2 - When you click on a post, it should take you to the users page.
3 - Star functionality: click to give post a star, click again to revoke star.

Bugs:
1 - [FIXED] Menu causes whole page to get a scroll bar, it should not.
2 - Undo sometimes causes stroke to appear different. Hard to replicate.
3 - [FIXED] Can't see stars on smaller resolutions.
3a - Text is cut off. Consider adding display names instead of using emails.
4 - [FIXED] Posts are loaded oldest to newest, should be reverse.
5 - [FIXED] Signout freezes the app.
6 - [Fixed] Refresh sends user back to the landing screen.
